                                    1. Stay calm – we understand it’s a frightening situation, but it’s important to try your best to remain composed.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    2. If your pet is on a sofa or bed, carefully move them down onto the floor.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    3. Clear some space around them so they can’t hurt themselves.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    4. Dim the lights and make the room as quiet as possible.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    5. Start a timer so you know how long the seizure lasts and, if possible, video your pet – this will provide valuable clues for your vet.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    6. Keep the room as cool as possible – seizures often cause a rise in body temperature.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    7. Call your vet if the seizure lasts for more than two minutes, or if it isn’t the first one your pet has had in the past 24 hours. Otherwise, call them once your pet has started to come round.

                                </p>
